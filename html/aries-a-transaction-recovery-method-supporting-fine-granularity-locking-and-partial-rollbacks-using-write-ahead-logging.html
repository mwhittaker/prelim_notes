<ul>
<li>WAL protocol: every change to a data object needs a record in a log; the record gets flushed before the corresponding change to the data item. - WAL is faster that force approach because data changes are smaller than the pages being changed and the log is append-only.</li>
<li>Periodically flushing pages to disk helps speed up recovery because the recLSNs will be bigger and we don't have to go back as far.</li>
<li>Checkpoint location is stored in the <em>master record</em>.</li>
<li>end records are written for committed transactions at the end of the redo phase</li>
<li>Shadow paging:
<ul>
<li>Access pages through page table</li>
<li>Transactions copy page table, copy pages, and swap page table upon commit</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Disadvantages of shadow paging:
<ul>
<li>Fragmentation leads to bad locality</li>
<li>Lower degrees of concurrency</li>
<li>Storage overhead of shadow pages</li>
<li>Recovery can lead to deadlocks</li>
</ul></li>
<li>partial rollbacks could be used for deadlocks instead of total rollbacks</li>
<li>have to log locks and re-acquire locks for txns in the in-doubt stage of 2PC</li>
<li>parallelism: apply redo in parallel with one thread per page being redone</li>
<li>parallelism: log CLRs serially, but then redo them in parallel</li>
<li>could try partially rolling back txns and restarting them, but it would require us to log a lot of state (the locks held, the cursors into data structures, etc)</li>
<li>deferred restart: acquire locks during redo and then open up the sytem for txns when we start undo. A txn will block on a page if it needs to be undone.</li>
<li>ARIES checkpoints after recovery is done</li>
<li>Checkpointing during recovery can help avoid redundant work on subsequent crashes</li>
<li>Media recovery. Media snapshot taken as of the most recent checkpoint. To recover the media, we reload it and start redo from the most recent checkpoint.</li>
<li>Nested top action: a top action is a sequence of things we don't want to undo. We log a dummy CLR at the end of the top action to prevent undo.</li>
<li>Q: Why does aries assume 2pl?</li>
<li>Q: ARIES for T/O.</li>
