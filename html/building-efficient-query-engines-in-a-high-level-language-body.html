<ul>
<li>Overview
<ul>
<li>Template based query compilation (where queries are directly translated operator-by-operator to stringified low-level code) misses a lot of optimization opportunities.</li>
<li>LegoBase instead compiles queries in an actually smart way.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Architecture
<ul>
<li>LegoBase compiles queries using a standard query optimizer to get a query plan. It then converts the query plan to LegoBase&#8217;s Scala/LMS implementation of the plan. It then performs a series of optimizations before eventually compiling down to C.</li>
<li>Scala to C: straightforward except Scala libraries mapped to GLib and Scala code must manually mark allocations and deletions because C doesn&#8217;t have a garbage collector</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Optimizations
<ul>
<li>Legobase can convert Volcano style pull operators into push style query operators. The transformation involves swapping callers and callees.</li>
<li>LegoBase can eliminate the redundant materializations across multiple operators using simple pattern matching on the Scala operators.</li>
<li>LegoBase can perform data structure specialization (e.g.&#160;hash table to array).</li>
<li>LegoBase can change the data layout of a relation (e.g.&#160;between row and column oriented).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Questions
<ul>
<li>Q: Give a concrete example of a query which builds redundant hashtables and how we can avoid creating them.</li>
<li>A: ???</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
