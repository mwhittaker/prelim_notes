<ul>
<li>Template based query compilation misses a lot of optimization opportunities</li>
<li>LegoBase uses LMS to compile Scala into partially evaluated Scala</li>
<li>Architecture: compile using standard optimizer, then convert to Scala LMS plan, then produce more optimized Scala, and then convert to C</li>
<li>Scala to C: straightforward except Scala libraries mapped to GLib and Scala code must manually mark allocations and deletions because C doesn't have a garbage collector</li>
<li>Optimizations
<ul>
<li>push to pull</li>
<li>eliminate redundant materializations</li>
<li>data structure specialization (hash table to array)</li>
<li>changing data layout (between row and column oriented)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
