<ul>
<li>Avoiding two-phase commit
<ul>
<li>2PC aborts because of crashes and because of logical aborts</li>
<li>If we replicate each node, then we can ensure a node never crashes</li>
<li>To replicate txns, we need determinism</li>
<li>Logical aborts only require one round of communication, not two</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Architecture: sequencer, schedulers, and storage</li>
<li>Sequencing epochs and Paxos replication</li>
<li>Two-phase locking respecting the log</li>
<li>Execution in which local reads are broadcast</li>
<li>Optimistic lock location prediction (OLLP) for determining read sets</li>
<li>Prefetch pages for txns that haven't even run yet</li>
<li>Zig-zag checkpoint in which all writes after a point in the global log are written elsewhere</li>
</ul>
