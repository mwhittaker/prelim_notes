<ul>
<li>Overview
<ul>
<li>There are a lot of different concurrency control algorithms and a lot of different (and contradictory) performance analyses. This paper aims to explain which assumptions were made to achieve each of the previous results.</li>
<li>Complete database model complete with users, physical resources, and workloads.</li>
<li>This paper looks at <em>resource assumptions</em> and transaction <em>modelling assumptions</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Concurrency Control Strategies
<ul>
<li>This paper explores three concurrency control algorithms.</li>
<li><strong>Blocking</strong>. Read and write locks are acquired. Whenever a transaction is blocked, deadlock detection is run, and the youngest transaction is aborted if there is deadlock.</li>
<li><strong>Immediate-Restart</strong>. Read and write locks are acquired. Whenever a transaction cannot acquire a lock, it is aborted and restarted after some adjustable amount of time.</li>
<li><strong>Optimistic</strong>. Transactions proceed in three phases: read, validate, write. At the beginning of the validate step, they are assigned a timestamp, and transactions are aborted if they do not conform to the timestamp-prescribed serial ordering.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Performance Model
<ul>
<li><strong>System Model</strong>: database hardware, concurrency control algorithm, etc.</li>
<li><strong>User Model</strong>: interactive or batch, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Transaction Model</strong>: workload characteristics, etc.</li>
<li>Performance model includes a queueing system in which transactions are queued in a ready queue (waiting to become active), concurrency control queue (waiting to make concurrency control requests), object queue (waiting to access database objects), blocked queue (waiting to become unblocked), or update queue (waiting to perform a deferred update).</li>
<li>CPUs and disks are also modelled as a bunch of queues. Reads and writes are serviced FIFO with data being spread equiprobably across disks.</li>
<li>Parameters include the number of objects in the database, the min/mean/max number of objects a transaction touches, the probability a transaction writes an item that it reads, the think time, the restart delay, the maximum number of allowable active transactions, the number of cpus/disks, and the time it takes to perform a CPU action and a disk action.</li>
<li>There are a lot of other low-level things the model does not capture (e.g. context switching cost, page thrashing).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Performance Metrics
<ul>
<li>Metrics considered include transactions per second, transaction delay, blocking ratio (the number of blocking actions per commit), restart ratio (the number of restarts per commit), the total disk utilization, and the useful disk utilization (the disk utilization for requests that are not later aborted).</li>
<li>All experiments have a common set of parameter settings which are not varied; see text for details.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Resource-Related Assumptions
<ul>
<li><strong>Experiment 1: Infinite Resources</strong>. Given infinite resources, higher degrees of parallelism lead to higher likelihoods of transaction conflict which in turn leads to higher likelihoods of transaction abort and restart. The blocking algorithm thrashes because of these increased conflicts. The immediate-restart algorithm plateaus because the dynamic delay effectively limits the amount of parallelism. The optimistic algorithm does well because aborted transactions are immediately replaced with other transactions. Blocking also has the smallest response time variance before it starts thrashing because it restarts transactions least often.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment 2: Limited Resources</strong>. With a limited number of resources, all three algorithms thrash, but blocking performs best. Immediate-Restart performs well when the degree of parallelism is high because the adaptive restart delay limits the effective parallelism. Adding an adaptive delay to the other two algorithms makes them perform at high degrees of parallelism as well.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment 3: Multiple Resources</strong>. The blocking algorithm performs best up to about 25 resource units (i.e. 25 CPUs and 50 disks); after that, the optimistic algorithm performs best.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment 4: Interactive Workloads</strong>. When transactions spend more time &quot;thinking&quot;, the system begins to behave more like it has infinite resources and the optimistic algorithm performs best.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Transaction Behavior Assumptions
<ul>
<li><strong>Experiment 6: Modeling Restarts</strong>. Some analyses model a transaction restart as the spawning of a completely new transaction. These fake restarts lead to higher throughput (especially for Immediate-Restart and Optimistic) because they avoid repeated transaction conflict.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment 7: Write-Lock Acquisition</strong>. Some analyses have transactions acquire read-locks and then upgrade them to write-locks. Others have transactions immediately acquire write-locks if the object will ever be written to. Upgrading locks can lead to deadlock if two transactions concurrently write to the same object. For limited parallelism, this doesn't have much of an effect. For higher degrees of parallelism, it can reduce throughput. The effect also vary with the number of resources; see text for details.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lessons learned
<ul>
<li>With low contention, all three concurrency control algorithms perform similarly.</li>
<li>Blocking is best for systems with medium to high resource utilization. Immediate-Restart or Optimistic is better for systems with low resource utilization.</li>
<li>Limiting the amount of parallelism can prevent thrashing.</li>
<li>Fake-restarts benefit Immediate-Restart and Optimistic, making Blocking look bad.</li>
<li>No-lock upgrade assumption favors Immediate-Restart and then Blocking.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Conclusion
<ul>
<li>A database model needs system model, user model, and transaction model.</li>
<li>If there is medium to high utilization, then blocking algorithms prevent wasted work and improve throughput. If there is low utilization, then restart-oriented algorithms can tolerate the wasted utilization and are preferable.</li>
</ul></li>
