<ul>
<li>Object Exchange Model (OEM)
<ul>
<li>Possibly cyclic graph of objects (with a designated root node) in which each vertex has an object id and each edge is annotated with a label. Leaves are annotated with data.</li>
<li><strong>Label path</strong>: a sequence of labels $l_1.l_2 \ldots l_n$.</li>
<li><strong>Data path</strong>: a sequence of labels and oids $l_1.o_1 \ldots l_n.o_n$.</li>
<li><strong>Instance of data path</strong>: $d$ is an instance of $l$ if the labels match.</li>
<li><strong>Target set of label path</strong>: set of oids reachable from $l$.</li>
<li>The Lorel query language allows querying OEM objects. For example, the query <code>SELECT Restaurant.Name WHERE Restaurant.Entree = 'Burger';</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>DataGuides
<ul>
<li>A <strong>DataGuide</strong> for an OEM object $s$ is an OEM object $d$ such that every label path of $s$ has exactly one data path in $d$ $d$, and every label path of $d$ $d$ is a label path of $s$ $s$.</li>
<li>A DataGuide $d$ can be used to quickly determine which label paths exist in $s$. It can also be used to determine which labels exist after a label path $l$.</li>
<li>Creating a DataGuide $d$ of $s$ is equivalent to determinizing $s$.</li>
<li>Multiple DataGuide exist, and the minimal one is not always preferable. It's harder to maintain and precludes annotations (described next).</li>
<li>A strong DataGuide $d$ of $s$ is a DataGuide with a bijection between the target sets of $s$ and the objects of $d$. It allows us to unambiguously store annotations in the objects of $d$.</li>
<li>To create a strong DataGuide, we simply perform the vanilla determinization procedure. Determinization can take exponential time, but the paper presents some experimental results showing that for typical databases, determinization runs quick enough.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Incremental maintenance
<ul>
<li>We represent changes to an OEM object as a set of edge insertions and deletions where each edge is represented as $u.l.v$.</li>
<li>For each $u.l.v$, we re-run the determinization procedure at every vertex that contains $u$, avoiding re-doing work that's already been done.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Query Formulation
<ul>
<li>Lore provides a web UI that users can use to browse DataGuides. They can expand and collapse the DataGuide and see samples of data for each object.</li>
<li>Users can also provide simple filters to form Lorel queries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Query Optimization
<ul>
<li>DataGuides expectedly speed up queries for a specific label path. They reduce the cost to time linear in the length of the label path.</li>
<li>Lore also has value indexes which can say, for example, the set of oids for a objects with incoming label year and value less than 1965. We can intersect DataGuide oids and vindex oids to answer SELECT-WHERE queries.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
