<h1 id="eddies-continuously-adaptive-query-processing">Eddies: Continuously Adaptive Query Processing</h1>
<ul>
<li>Adaptability over best case performance</li>
<li>Synchronization barriers (sort-merge join)</li>
<li>Moments of symmetry (nested loop join)</li>
<li>Pre-optimization</li>
<li>Done and ready bits</li>
<li>Eddy as a wrapper around data sources and n operators</li>
<li>Each operator runs in its own thread with a message queue</li>
<li>Naive eddy: learn delay of operators by filling up message queues</li>
<li>Fast eddy: learn selectivities of operators using lottery scheduling</li>
<li>Dynamic performance and windowed lottery scheduling</li>
</ul>
