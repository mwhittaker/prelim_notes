<ul>
<li>The Bracket Model of Parallelization
<ul>
<li>In the bracket model of computation (used by databases like Bubba and Gamma), a template process wraps up operators. The operators invoke code within the templates to send and receive messages, and this <em>must</em> be done over the network. This makes everything slow.</li>
<li><p>For example, given an <code>Operator</code> class, we can imagine a <code>Template</code> class that looks something like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode java"><code class="sourceCode java"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">public</span> <span class="kw">class</span> Template {</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" data-line-number="2">    <span class="kw">private</span> Operator o;</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-3" data-line-number="3">    <span class="kw">public</span> <span class="fu">Template</span>(Operator o) { <span class="kw">this</span>.<span class="fu">o</span> = o; }</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-4" data-line-number="4">    <span class="kw">public</span> <span class="fu">run</span>() { <span class="kw">this</span>.<span class="fu">o</span>.<span class="fu">run</span>(<span class="kw">this</span>); }</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-5" data-line-number="5"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-6" data-line-number="6">    <span class="co">// Receive a tuple from the left child over the network.</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-7" data-line-number="7">    <span class="kw">public</span> Tuple <span class="fu">recvLeft</span>() {...}</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-8" data-line-number="8">    <span class="co">// Receive a tuple from the right child over the network.</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-9" data-line-number="9">    <span class="kw">public</span> Tuple <span class="fu">recvRight</span>() {...}</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-10" data-line-number="10">    <span class="co">// Send a tuple over the network.</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-11" data-line-number="11">    <span class="kw">public</span> <span class="dt">void</span> <span class="fu">send</span>(Tuple) {...}</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-12" data-line-number="12">}</a></code></pre></div></li>

<li>Volcano System Design
<ul>
<li>Volcano implements queries as a tree of iterators with an open-next-close interface. The paper discusses something called state records which allow the same operator multiple times with different parameters, though this seems obsolete now that we have modern programming languages.</li>
<li>Iterators return structures which contain record ids and pointers to the records which are pinned in the buffer pool.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Operator Model of Parallelization
<ul>
<li><strong>Pipeline parallelism</strong>: when a pipelined volcano operator is created, it forks a child for its subtree that eagerly writes tuples into a bounded buffer that the parent reads whenever it&#8217;s <code>next</code> method is invoked.</li>
<li><strong>Horizontal Parallelism</strong>: when a horizontal volcano operator is created, it spawns some number of producer threads, one of which is designated the master. The producer threads partition their inputs to the consumer threads. There are special operators to read from disk in parallel.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Variants of the Exchange Operator
<ul>
<li>The producers of a horizontal volcano operator can broadcast their data to all consumers (instead of partitioning it) to do stuff like a broadcast join.</li>
<li>A merge iterator can merge together multiple sorted runs from its children, though the implementation breaks the operator abstraction a bit.</li>
<li>There is also some discussion on managing processes, but it is confusing.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
