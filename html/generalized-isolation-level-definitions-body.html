<ul>
<li>tl;dr This paper has two contributions: (1) defining isolation levels in terms of dependency graphs and (2) beefing up the database model to handle versions.</li>
<li>Overview:
<ul>
<li>Gray: English definitions that were too aggressive.</li>
<li>ANSI: English definitions that were too permissive (e.g. $W_1(X), R_2(X), R_2(Y), W_2(Y), C_1, C_2$ allowed).</li>
<li>Berenson: Semi-formal definitions that were too aggressive (e.g. $W_1(X), W_2(X), C_1, C_2$ disallowed). These definitions pretty muched forced you to do locking.</li>
<li>Adya: Formal definitions that are just right (and include versions).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Degrees of consistency
<ul>
<li>English definitions</li>
<li>Degree 1: read uncommitted, long write locks, no read locks</li>
<li>Degree 2: read committed, long write locks, short read locks</li>
<li>Degree 3: serializable, long write locks, long read (phantom) locks</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ANSI SQL Standard
<ul>
<li>English definitions</li>
<li>All wrong</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Critique of ANSI SQL
<ul>
<li>Semi-formal definitions</li>
<li>P0: dirty write</li>
<li>P1: dirty read</li>
<li>P2: non-repeatable read</li>
<li>P3: phantom</li>
<li>RU: No P0</li>
<li>RC: No P0, P1</li>
<li>RR: No P0, P1, P2</li>
<li>Serializable: No P0, P1, P2, P3</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Database Model
<ul>
<li>In Adya&#8217;s database model, all objects are versioned. Reads and writes are partially ordered with the (obvious) restrictions that
<ul>
<li>a transaction&#8217;s reads and writes are ordered,</li>
<li>a read of a value is ordered after the write,</li>
<li>a transaction must read its own writes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There is a separate total order of object versions that is independent of the order of events in the partial order of events (think of how with MVCC/TO, the order in which writes is serialized isn&#8217;t directly related to the order in which the writes occur).</li>
<li>Predicate reads return a set of versions for each object being read. Reading and writing these versions happens in subsequent, separate read and write operations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Dependency graphs
<ul>
<li><strong>Write dependencies (ww)</strong> $T_j$ ww depends on $T_i$ if $T_j$ writes $x_j$ and $x_j$ immediately follows $x_i$ written by $T_i$.</li>
<li><strong>Read dependencies (wr)</strong> $T_j$ wr depends on $T_i$ if $T_j$ reads $x_i$ (written by $T_i$) or if $T_j$ performs a predicate read of a version that most recently changed by $T_i$.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-dependency (rw)</strong> $T_j$ rw depends on $T_i$ if $T_j$ writes $x_j$ which is the version immediately following the one read by $T_i$ or if $T_i$ performs a predicate read of a version that $T_j$ is later the first to change.</li>
<li>Dependency graphs do <em>not</em> include aborted transactions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Generalized Isolation Specifications
<ul>
<li>G0: No cycles consisting of only ww edges.</li>
<li>G1: No cycles consisting of only wr and ww edges, no reading data from aborted transactions, and no reading the intermediate values of transactions.</li>
<li>G2-item: No cycles consisting of only wr, ww, and rw-item edges.</li>
<li>G2: No cycles of any kind.</li>
<li>PL-1 (RU): Dissalows G0.</li>
<li>PL-2 (RC): Dissalows G1.</li>
<li>PL-2.99 (RR): Dissalows G1, G2-item.</li>
<li>PL-3(S): Dissalows G1, G2.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
