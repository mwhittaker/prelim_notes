<ul>
<li>Overview
<ul>
<li>Hekaton is an embedded OLTP engine inside of Microsoft SQL Server.</li>
<li>Hekaton uses tricks like storing everything in memory, compiled stored procedures, latch-free data structures, and fancy optimistic multiversion concurrency control to efficiently implement transactions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Guiding principles
<ul>
<li>Optimized indexes for main memory (and don&#8217;t log index operations; recover them completely from scratch upon recovery).</li>
<li>Eliminate latches and locks.</li>
<li>Compile requests to native code.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t partition data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Storage and indexing
<ul>
<li>Hekaton relations are stored row-by-row where each tuple is of the form (logical begin timestamp, logical end timestamps, index links, data).</li>
<li>Latch-free hash indexes and Bw-tree indexes point into the relations, and the links within the tuples connect tuples that fall within the same bucket.</li>
<li>If a read is performed at time $t$, then only tuples with a begin time before $t$ and an end time after $t$ are read. Reads at time $t$ read all versions within a bucket but only return the versions as of time $t$.</li>
<li>When a transaction deletes a tuple, it places its transaction id in the end timestamp field (and later replaces it with its commit timestamp).</li>
<li>When a transaction inserts a tuple, it places its transaction id in begin timestamp field (and later replaces it with its commit timestamp).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Query compilation
<ul>
<li>Stored procedures are optimized into mixed abstract syntax trees (MAT) and then into pure imperative trees (PIT) and then into C code.</li>
<li><code>CREATE TABLE</code> commands are compiled into a set of procedures for manipulating records in the table.</li>
<li>Query plans are compiled to C code that doesn&#8217;t use function calls; instead, it uses gotos and labels. The paper argues that this kind of code is smaller and faster. Complicated code for things like sorting is linked in and called via a function.</li>
<li>Compiled queries have some technical restrictions and limitations ( e.g.&#160;if a table&#8217;s schema is changed, stored procedures which operate on the table must be dropped).</li>
<li>Microsoft SQL Server also supports fully featured interpreted queries to overcome these restrictions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Transaction management
<ul>
<li>Hekaton uses an optimistic multiversion concurrency control scheme for read uncommited, snapshot isolation, repeatable read, and serializable transactions.</li>
<li>Every transaction is given a start timestamp at start and a commit timestamp at end.</li>
<li>All reads are issued as of the start timestamp.</li>
<li>Transactions first perform their reads and then perform their writes. Upon trying to commit, the transaction has to satisfy a couple of properties:
<ul>
<li>All the current read versions are the same as the ones read.</li>
<li>All the scans can be repeated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Repeatable read only requires the first test; snapshot isolation and read committed doesn&#8217;t require either.</li>
<li>These tests are checked with stored read sets and phantom sets.</li>
<li>Transactions record commit dependencies and wait for all commit dependencies are cleared before committing. Cascading aborts are possible. Reads are not returned to the user until all pending commit dependencies are cleared.</li>
<li>Transactions maintain a write set to replace their transaction ids with their commit timestamps in the tuples that they wrote.</li>
<li><em>Note</em> that while both C-Store/Spanner and Hekaton use timestamps, Hekaton is not allowing historical reads. Once a version is obsolete, it can be garbage collected.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Durability and Recovery
<ul>
<li>Principles
<ul>
<li>Log instead of random access. Also, batch.</li>
<li>Push work to recovery time.</li>
<li>Do recovery in parallel.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hekaton stores <strong>log streams</strong> and <strong>checkpoint streams</strong> (in the form of <strong>data streams</strong> and <strong>delta streams</strong>).</li>
<li>At commit, all the insertions and deletions of a transaction (actually multiple are batched) are appended at once to stable storage in the log stream.</li>
<li>Periodically, the tail of the log stream are pushed into new or existing data and delta streams.</li>
<li>On recovery, the data and delta streams are replayed in parallel (with the delta streams filtering out the data streams) and then the tail of the log is played back.</li>
<li>Index operations not logged; all indexes are rebuilt on recovery.</li>
<li>Periodically, data and delta stream pairs are merged to collapse multiple data streams with very few remaining tuples.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Garbage Collection
<ul>
<li>A tuple is garbage if it was deleted at a time before all pending transaction timestamps (or if it was written by a rolled back transaction).</li>
<li>Online: whenever a transaction scans the entries of an index, it can unlink old values. This helps keep hot indexes clean.</li>
<li>Offline: transaction processing nodes alternate between GC and processing to tidy up the dusty corners.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Questions
<ul>
<li>Q: How can Hekaton&#8217;s transaction validation happen without taking any locks?</li>
<li>A: ???</li>
<li>Q: How exactly does Hekaton unlinking work during GC?</li>
<li>A: A bit unclear exactly what&#8217;s going on with unlinking.</li>
</ul></li>
