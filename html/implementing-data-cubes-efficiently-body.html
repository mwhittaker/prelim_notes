<ul>
<li>Lattices, roll-ups, and drill-downs</li>
<li>Product lattice Hasse diagram as a hypercube</li>
<li>Cost model of evaluating cuboid is the minimum cardinality of cuboid greater than it</li>
<li>Minimize running all cuboids subject to fixed number of views: Repeatedly choose cuboid which maximizes benefit</li>
<li>Minimize running all weighted cuboids subject to fixed number of views: Repeatedly choose cuboid which maximizes weighted benefit</li>
<li>Minimize running all weighted cuboids subject to fixed space: Repeatedly choose cuboid which maximizes weighted benefit / space of cuboid</li>
<li>Benefit of greedy is at least 63% (1 - 1/e) of the optimal</li>
