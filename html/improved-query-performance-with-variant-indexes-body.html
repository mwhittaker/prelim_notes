<ul>
<li>tl;dr
<ul>
<li>This paper surveys B+ tree indexes, bitmap indexes, projection indexes, and bit-sliced indexes and how to use them to evaluate single-column sums with a filter, &#8230;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Value-List Indexes
<ul>
<li>A Value-List index is just a B+ tree that maps a key to a set of RIDs.</li>
<li>If rids are of the form (page id, offset), then the rid lists in the leaves of a B+ tree can be grouped by page id. The rids within a page&#8217;s group do not need to repeat the page id. This saves space.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bitmap Indexes
<ul>
<li>A Bitmap index is a B+ tree that maps a key to a bitmap.</li>
<li>If RIDs are 4 bytes = 32 bits each, then the size of the leaf-level of a B+ tree is roughly $32n$ where $n$ is the number of rows. The leaf-level of a bitmap index is roughly $nk$ bits where $k$ is the number of columns. If $k &lt; 32$, then the bitmap index uses less space.</li>
<li>If $k$ is big, we can compress the bitmaps, but a compressed bitmap is essentially an RID list, so we end up back with a value-list index.</li>
<li>The paper claims that bitmap operations are faster than RID set operations so long as $k &lt; 100$ (i.e.&#160;the bitmaps are at least 1% full).</li>
<li>As an example imagine a relation <code>R(K10, K25)</code> and a query</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>SELECT K10, K25, COUNT(*)
FROM R
GROUP BY K10, K25</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s faster to iterate over all 250 pairs of bitmaps and perform the AND and COUNT than it is to perform a standard sort-based group by.</li>
<li>If a bitmap is segmented and it is known ahead of time that some segments contain all 0s or all 1s or something like that, they can be processed more efficiently.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Projection Indexes
<ul>
<li>A projection index of a relation <code>R(a, b, c)</code> on column <code>a</code> is just the column <code>a</code> of <code>R</code> stored contiguously sorted in the same order as <code>R</code>. This is very much like projections in C-store except that the projections are not sorted on the columns.</li>
<li>A query that only reads one column will read fewer bytes from the projection than from the whole relation. This is standard column store stuff.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bit-Sliced Indexes
<ul>
<li>A bit sliced index over an integer-valued column views each integer as a bitstring. It then stores a bitmap per column. See https://mwhittaker.github.io/papers/html/o1997improved.html for an illustration.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Comparing Index types for Aggregate Evaluation
<ul>
<li>Single-Column SUM <code>SELECT SUM(a) FROM R WHERE &lt;predicate&gt;</code>
<ul>
<li>Here, we assume that we have a bitmap for the predicate.</li>
<li><strong>No index</strong>: Use the bitmap to scan through the relation, computing the sum on the fly.</li>
<li><strong>Projection index</strong>: Use the bitmap to scan through the relation, computing the sum on the fly.</li>
<li><strong>Bitmap index</strong>: Iterate through the (key, bitmap) pairs computing the sum as key*count(bitmap AND predicate bitmap).</li>
<li><strong>B+ tree index</strong>: Iterate through the (key, rid list) pairs computing the sum as key * count(rid list intersect predicate bitmap).</li>
<li><strong>Bit-sliced index</strong>: Compute the sum as a sum of 2^i * count(ith column).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Algorithms for COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN, MEDIAN, and Column-Product (the SUM of products of two columns) are also briefly discussed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Evaluating Range Predicates
<ul>
<li><code>SELECT * FROM R WHERE c op k AND &lt;predicate&gt;</code></li>
<li>As before, we assume that we have a bitmap for the predicate.</li>
<li><strong>Projection index</strong>: Scan through the index using the predicate.</li>
<li><strong>Bitmap index</strong>: Compute the OR of all bitmaps in the range and AND it with the predicate. Use this to retrieve the values.</li>
<li><strong>B+ tree index</strong>: We compute the union of all rid sets and turn them into a bitmap, or turn each rid set into a bitmap and or them together.</li>
<li><strong>Bit-sliced index</strong>: Crazy bit tricks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Evaluating OLAP-style Queries
<ul>
<li>Imagine we want to evaluate a join like</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>SELECT A.aa, B.bb, C.cc, SUM(F.f)
FROM F, A, B, C
WHERE F.a = A.a AND F.b = B.b AND F.c = C.c
      A.x = 1 AND B.x = 2 AND C.x = 3
GROUP BY A.aa, B.bb, C.cc</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>First, we can create a projection <strong>join index</strong> on <code>F</code> that simply stores the values of <code>A.x</code>, <code>B.x</code>, and <code>C.x</code>. For example, if F is the following:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>F(a, b, c)
+---+---+---+
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 2 |
| 1 | 2 | 1 |
| 1 | 2 | 2 |
| 2 | 1 | 1 |
+---+---+---+</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>We can create the following indexes:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code> A.aa  B.bb  C.cc
+---+ +---+ +---+
| 6 | | 8 | | 4 |
| 6 | | 8 | | 3 |
| 6 | | 9 | | 4 |
| 6 | | 9 | | 3 |
| 7 | | 8 | | 4 |
+---+ +---+ +---+
 A.x   B.x   C.x
+---+ +---+ +---+
| 6 | | 8 | | 4 |
| 6 | | 8 | | 3 |
| 6 | | 9 | | 4 |
| 6 | | 9 | | 3 |
| 7 | | 8 | | 4 |
+---+ +---+ +---+</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Now, we can compute the filter using these join indexes.</li>
<li>To compute the group by using projection indexes over aa, bb, cc, and f, we simply scan through them and compute the groups in memory or do a sorting or hashing based group by.</li>
<li>If instead we have a B+ tree over aa, bb, and cc, we can perform a nested for loop over the indexes computing the intersections of the corresponding bitmaps.</li>
<li>If we cluster F according to these groups, then segmentation will help us avoid performing full bitmap intersections.</li>
<li>We can also create an index mapping a group to its offset in the group-sorted file.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
