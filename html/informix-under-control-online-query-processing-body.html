<ul>
<li>Overview
<ul>
<li>When you submit a SQL query to a traditional relational database, it runs for a while, you sit there waiting patiently, and then it spits out an answer. For big data or complicated queries, you might be sitting and waiting patiently for quite some time. This paper focuses on how to implement a database which streams and iteratively refines output to give users more insight into what&#8217;s going on.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Application Scenarios
<ul>
<li><strong>Online aggregation</strong>: users issue a group-by query like <code>SELECT college, AVG(grade) FROM enroll GROUP BY college</code> and see an iteratively refined confidence interval for each college. Controls can speed up or slow down the processing of certain groups.</li>
<li><strong>Online enumeration</strong>: users interact with a spreadsheet that lazily streams in data values from a database.</li>
<li><strong>Online data visualization</strong>: visualizations, like showing a heat map of field goal percentage on a basketball court, can involve streaming in data lazily and aggregating it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Randomized Data Access and Physical Database Design
<ul>
<li>Things like online aggregation require us to draw random samples of the data (otherwise the confidence bars would be all out of whack).</li>
<li>Informix stores data randomly on disk by clustering on a pseudo-random pseudo-key.</li>
<li>To insert a tuple into the randomly shuffled data, we randomly replace an existing tuple and append the replaced tuple.</li>
<li>Repeatedly scanning the shuffled data can lead to statistical anomalies, so we start at randomly selected offsets or re-shuffle the data every once in a while</li>
<li>We can also store a B+ tree on a pseudo-random pseudo-key to keep the underlying data sorted in a more sane way</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reorderability
<ul>
<li>During an online aggregation, if a user prefers to see more of one group of tuples, we have to select tuples from that group more quickly.</li>
<li>A re-order operator can pre-fetch tuples from disk and output the more &#8220;interesting&#8221; tuples output, spilling the less interesting ones to disk. This assumes that the fetching cost is significantly faster than the processing cost.</li>
<li>Alternatively, we can open up a pointer to every group in an index on the grouping columns and lottery schedule between them. This works best with low-cardinality indexes to avoid a lot of random I/O.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ripple joins
<ul>
<li>An interactive system cannot use a blocking join like sort-merge join or grace hash join.</li>
<li>Nested loop joins stream data out, but the order in which they process data is heavily biased; we look at every entry of the inner relation before seeing the next value of the outer relation.</li>
<li>A ripple join samples incrementally from both relations and the relative sampling rates can be adjusted based on which attributes contribute to the variance of the output more.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Grouping
<ul>
<li>If the number of groups can fit into memory, then a hash based group by will stream out data results. A sort based grouping will not.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Client-Server Interfaces
<ul>
<li>Online aggregation and enumeration necessitates the user sending feedback about the query as it executes. Traditional relational database client-server interfaces do not support this.</li>
<li>The authors added a low-level C direct API.</li>
<li>They also added an OBDC embedding. Confidence intervals are specified with UDFs, and streams of iteratively refined aggregates are streamed to the client. There is a UDF to pause and speed up groups (e.g. <code>SELECT pause_group(x)</code>).</li>
<li>Ideally, the server could evaluate the query while messages are being sent to client, but Informix&#8217;s architecture didn&#8217;t support this nicely. Instead, the server just outputs a tuple after processing $k$ tuples.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implementing Online Query Operators
<ul>
<li>$k$-way index scans for reordering were more expensive than necessary because it was too complicated to change the internals of the storage system.</li>
<li>Ripple joins re-scan the same input multiple times, and we need to make sure that the scan order is the same every time.</li>
<li>This can be hard when the operators (e.g.&#160;random scan or explicit re-order) may not return tuples in same order.</li>
<li>Two options: cache and replay tuples (spilling to disk if need be) and/or make sure non-deterministic operators become deterministic (e.g.&#160;by logging random seeds and user interactions during a re-ordering).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Constructing Online Query Plans
<ul>
<li>Informix has three access plans to choose from that lie on a spectrum trading off performance and controllability: sequential scan, sequential scan with re-order, $k$-way index scan.</li>
<li>Re-ordering tuples on GROUP BY column formed from a join is left for future work.</li>
<li>Online optimization is mostly left for future work. They use a couple of heuristics for the moment (e.g.&#160;let Informix choose join order, use a $k$-way index scan if possible and otherwise don&#8217;t).</li>
<li>Eddies can also be applied here.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Beyond Select-Project-Join
<ul>
<li>The client is responsible for evaluating ORDER BY and HAVING queries.</li>
<li>Nested subqueries is left for future work.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
