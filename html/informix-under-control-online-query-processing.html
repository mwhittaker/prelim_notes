<ul>
<li>OLAP data is big and queries are hard to write =&gt; waste a lot of time</li>
<li>Application scenarios
<ul>
<li>Online aggregation: see values for groups and toggle speed for each group</li>
<li>Online enumeration: lazy loaded spreadsheet</li>
<li>Online data visualization: a combination of aggregation and enumeration</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Random data access
<ul>
<li>Physically store data in order based on random pseudo-key</li>
<li>To insert, randomly replace existing tuple</li>
<li>To avoid non-random repeated scans, randomly offset scans or re-shuffle data every once in a while</li>
<li>Can also store a B+ tree on a random pseudo-key to keep the underlying data sorted in a more sane way</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reorderability
<ul>
<li>If a user prefers to see more of one group of tuples, we have to select those quicker</li>
<li>Re-order operator can buffer tuples from below and preferentially output the ones the user wants, spilling the rest to disk</li>
<li>Can open up a pointer to every group in an index on the grouping columns and lottery schedule between them; works best with low-cardinality indexes to avoid a lot of random I/O</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ripple joins
<ul>
<li>Cannot use blocking joins</li>
<li>Ripple joins allow us to change the rate of sampling of the two relations to better narrow down variance</li>
</ul></li>
<li>GROUP BY has to be implemented as a hash, not a sort</li>
<li>API
<ul>
<li>Direct API</li>
<li>OBDC embedding: UDFs for aggregates with confidence intervals, tuples returned with latest value, UDF for pausing or accelerating groups</li>
<li>Ideally, server could evaluate query while messages are being sent to client, but alternatively the server just outputs every k requests</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implementation of operators
<ul>
<li>Ripple join re-scans same input multiple times, and we need to make sure that the scan order is the same every time</li>
<li>This can be hard when the operators (e.g. random scan or explicit re-order) may not return tuples in same order</li>
<li>Two options: cache and replay (spilling to disk if need be) and or make sure things below are determinstic</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Optimization
<ul>
<li>3 access plans (sequential scan, sequential scan with re-order, index trick) have varying degrees of speed and controllability</li>
<li>Re-order on GROUP BY from multiple joins future work</li>
<li>Optimization mostly future work</li>
<li>Join ordering: eddies</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ORDER BY and Having implemented by client</li>
</ul>
