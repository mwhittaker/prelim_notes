<ul>
<li><p>tl;dr This paper has two novelties: (1) bundle individual writes with dependency checks and merge procedures to let users define what a conflict is and how to (try to) resolve it and (2) eventual consistency via gossiping a totally ordered log in which operations are undone/redone and eventually committed by a single master.</p></li>
<li>Eventually consistent gossip with user-defined write conflict resolution</li>
<li>Meeting room example</li>
<li>Dependency check SQL query + expected results</li>
<li>Merge procedure rewrites query or logs errors on failure</li>
<li>Writes timestamped and gossiped and executed in order immediately (might have to undo writes)</li>
<li>Committed writes ordered before tentative writes</li>
<li>Could commit once timestamp is greater than low watermark for all servers</li>
<li>Bayou uses single master to decide commit</li>
<li>Storage system
<ul>
<li>Write log of committed and tentative writes with garbage collection and care not to reintroduce write via old gossip</li>
<li>Tuple store with bits for tentative or committed</li>
<li>Undo log to undo stuff</li>
</ul></li>
