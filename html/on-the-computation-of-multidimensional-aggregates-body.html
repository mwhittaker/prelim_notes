<ul>
<li>Cubes, cuboids, and base cuboid</li>
<li>Homomorphic aggregation functions</li>
<li>Three methods for computation
<ul>
<li>Independent: compute all cuboids from base cuboid</li>
<li>Parent: iteratively compute every cuboid from its parent</li>
<li>Overlap: perform parent method in parallel</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sorted run (matching l columns, l projected out)</li>
<li>Partition (matching l-1 columns, l projected out)</li>
<li>Choose parent with dropped attribute furthest right (e.g. R(A,C) wants R(A,C,D), instead of R(A,B,C))</li>
<li>If partitions fit in memory, we can compute in one pass and pipeline</li>
<li>Otherwise, we write sorted runs to disk and merge them later</li>
<li>Allocating which cuboids to run at once is NP-complete; breadth-first search left-to-right heuristic</li>
<li>Combine runs from later partitions into runs from earlier partitions</li>
<li>Make right cuboids small and sort attributes in decreasing order of distinct values to minimize the number of sorted runs</li>
</ul>
