<ul>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>&quot;Graph-parallel abstractions rely on each vertex having a small neighborhood to maximize parallelism and effective partitioning to minimize communication&quot;.</li>
<li>Existing graph processing frameworks do not handle power-law graphs (graphs in which a small number of vertices are incident to a large fraction of the edges) well.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Graph-Parallel Abstractions
<ul>
<li>&quot;In contrast to more general message passing models, graphparallel abstractions constrain the interaction of vertexprogram to a graph structure enabling the optimization of data-layout and communication.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Pregel</strong>. In a series of super-steps, a vertex with sum its inputs using an associative commutative operator, perform a vertex function, and then send messages to all its neighbors. Pregel terminates when there are no pending messages and all vertices vote to terminate. Note that Pregel is a bulk synchronous message passing abstraction.</li>
<li><strong>GraphLab</strong>. Data is stored on each vertex and on each edge. A vertex can read the data on all neighboring edges and vertices and then update its state. Vertices can also schedule neighbors to run. GraphLab ensures serializability. Note that GraphLab is an asynchronous shared memory abstraction.</li>
<li>In the gather-apply-scatter abstraction (GAS), vertices sum gathered data from neighbors ($S \gets \oplus_{u} g(D_v, D_{v,u}, D_u)$), apply the sum to make a new state ($D_v' \gets a(D_v, S)$), and scatter the state to all neighbors ($D_{v,u}' \gets s(D_v', D_{v,u}, D_u)$).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Challenges of Natural Graphs
<ul>
<li>Existing graph processing frameworks require computation, communication, and storage proportional to the degree of the vertex, which can be highly skewed. Power-law graphs can also be very hard to partition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>PowerGraph Abstraction
<ul>
<li>&quot;By lifting the Gather and Scatter phases into the abstraction, PowerGraph is able to retain the natural &#8220;think-like-a-vertex&#8221; philosophy [30] while distributing the computation of a single vertex-program over the entire cluster.&quot; Pregel abstracts gather but not scatter. GraphLab doesn't abstract either.</li>
<li>PowerGraph vertex programs explicitly implement <code>gather</code>, <code>sum</code>, <code>apply</code>, and <code>scatter</code> functions which are parallelized over edges. Vertex programs also explicitly activate neighbors.</li>
<li>If the accumulator forms an Abelian group, then scatter can return deltas which are added to neighboring state to maintain the summed gather incrementally.</li>
<li>PowerGraph programs can be executed in a bulk synchronous fashion (gather/sum is called on all nodes, then apply, then scatter) or in an asynchronous (yet serializable) fashion.</li>
<li>PowerGraph subsumes Pregel and GraphLab.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Distributed Graph Placement
<ul>
<li>Most graph processing systems perform an edge cut. Vertices are distributed as evenly as possible while minimizing the number of cut edges. Existing graph processing frameworks do not partition power-law graphs well.</li>
<li>With PowerGraph, vertices (as opposed to edges) are cut. Gather and scatter is applied in parallel while intermediate accumulators are communicated between vertex replicas. The distribution strategy tries to minimize the average amount of vertex duplication under the constraint that the edges are evenly divided (modulo a slack factor) amongst the machines.</li>
<li>A random vertex cut (where we randomly assign edges to machines) turns out to a pretty good vertex cut for power-law graphs. This also ends up being pretty good for non-power-law graphs.</li>
<li>A greedy heuristic can perform even better. Sequentially assign each edge $(u, v)$. If $u$ and $v$ reside on the same node (i.e. $A(u) \cap A(v) \neq \emptyset$), put the edge there. If $u$ and $v$ are both assigned but do not reside on the same node (i.e. $A(u) \neq \emptyset, A(v) \neq \emptyset, A(u) \cap A(v) = \emptyset$), then put the edge on a machine for $u$ or $v$, whichever has more unassigned edges. If only one of $u$ or $v$ has been assigned, then put the edge there. If neither $u$ nor $v$ has been assigned, then put the edge on the least loaded machine.</li>
<li>This algorithm is guaranteed to be better than the random algorithm, but it requires more coordination.</li>
