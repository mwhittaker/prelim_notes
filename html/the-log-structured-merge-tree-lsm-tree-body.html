<h1 id="the-log-structured-merge-tree-lsm-tree">The log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree)</h1>
<ul>
<li>tl;dr
<ul>
<li>If your system gets more writes than reads, you should batch up writes and make them sequential, and slowly move these writes into a more structured form on disk in the background. The LSM-tree is a realization of this idea for B+-tree indexes.</li>
<li>We also see this idea in C-store with WS data slowly being moved to RS. Here, it&#8217;s done because the RS data structures are expensive to maintain. We also see in Hekaton because we want to minimize the number of disk writes we do and the fact that all reads can be serviced from memory.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The two component LSM-tree algorithm
<ul>
<li>A two component LSM-tree consists of an in-memory $C_0$ tree (which doesn&#8217;t have to a B+ tree) and an on-disk $C_1$ B+ tree that is densely packed with every layer of the tree stored contiguously.</li>
<li>Periodically, the leaves of $C_1$ are read into memory a (multi-page) block at a time and merged with the leaves of $C_0$. These new leaves are then written back to $C_1$. Whenever a $C_1$ split occurs, the parents of the leaves also have to be written back to $C_1$.</li>
<li>Searches read first from $C_0$, then from $C_1$, then from $C_2$, etc. If the search key is not a primary key, all components have to be read. If the search key is a primary key, then the search can stop whenever the key is found.</li>
<li>Deletions produce tombstones in $C_0$ which are slowly rolled out to the other components.</li>
<li>Batch deletions (e.g.&#160;delete all tuples where $R.x &lt; 10$) can be deferred and integrated into the rolling merge. The merge will delete entries of $C_1$ that meet the deletion criterion.</li>
<li>Long-latency searches can also be integrated into the merge process, slowly accumulating the results as the merges take place.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cost-performance
<ul>
<li>The paper goes into some detail comparing the insertion cost into a B+ tree with the insertion cost into an LSM-tree. The details seem unimportant. The takeaway is that an LSM tree is faster because it performs multi-page block reads and writes instead of a lot of random reads and writes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The multi-component LSM-tree
<ul>
<li>Imagine that we have a huge $C_1$ and a small $C_0$. The number of pages for a given range in $C_1$ might be way, <em>way</em> bigger than the number of pages for the same range in $C_0$. If so, we end up reading a lot of pages from $C_1$ without merging in many values from $C_0$. Thus, $C_0$ shouldn&#8217;t be too big compared to $C_0$.</li>
<li>If our data is really big and the size of $C_0$ is limited by the amount of memory we have available, then we can make a third $C_2$ component, and then a fourth $C_3$ component, etc. Reads slow but writes remain fast.</li>
<li>The paper goes through a great deal of effort to show how to compute the optimal sizes of the trees given some settings for things like the total size, or the number of components and the size of $C_0$, etc. They walk through proofs and examples.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Concurrency Control in the LSM-tree
<ul>
<li>An LSM-tree concurrency control mechanism must avoid three types of conflicts:
<ol type="1">
<li>A read on a disk backed LSM-tree $C_i$ conflicts with a rolling merge that is updated $C_i$.</li>
<li>A read of or write to the in-memory LSM-tree $C_0$ conflicts with a rolling merge that is updating $C_0$.</li>
<li>$C_i$ merges with $C_{i-1}$ and $C_{i + 1}$. These two merges can conflict with one another when their cursors overtake one another.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>For disk-backed components, entries being modified by a rolling merge are locked in exclusive mode, and nodes being read are locked in shared mode. Locks are acquired at the granularity of nodes.</li>
<li>The locking protocol for $C_0$ depends on the type of tree used, but could likely use the same scheme as the on-disk components.</li>
<li>After a node is processed as part of a merge, all write locks are released to allow another merge to potentially overtake it.</li>
<li>The paper admits that the details here are a little hand-wavy and getting things figured out is left to future work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Recovery in the LSM-tree
<ul>
<li>To recover $C_0$, we can use the existing recovery log.</li>
<li>When a checkpoint is requested, we perform the following:
<ul>
<li>We pause all merges and insertions.</li>
<li>We write $C_0$ to disk. After this, we can resume insertions.</li>
<li>We write all buffered disk nodes to disk.</li>
<li>We write the position in the log to disk.</li>
<li>We write the address of all $C_i$ to disk.</li>
<li>We write the cursors of all $C_i$ to disk.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The paper discusses that this introduces a long pause, but argue that it&#8217;s not that bad.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
