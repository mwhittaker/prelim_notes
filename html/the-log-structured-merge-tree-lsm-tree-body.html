<h1 id="the-log-structured-merge-tree-lsm-tree">The log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree)</h1>
<ul>
<li>2 component LSM-tree
<ul>
<li>C0 in-memory component (some sort of tree, not necessarily a B+ tree)</li>
<li>C1 on-disk, densely-packed, contiguously-allocated B+ tree component</li>
<li>Multi-page sections of C0 and C1 are merged together and written back to C1, sort of like bulk inserting</li>
<li>Finds must read from C0 and then from C1</li>
<li>Deletions tombstoned in C0</li>
<li>Batch deletions can be deferred to when the portion of the deletes are brought into memory for merging</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Multi-component LSM-trees
<ul>
<li>Imagine a huge C1 and a small C0. The number of pages for a given range in C1 might be way bigger than the number of pages for C0. If so, we end up reading way too many pages</li>
<li>Multi-component LSM trees has a series of increasingly large trees on disk</li>
<li>There is a way to find the optimal sizes that is described in the paper, but its complicated</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Concurrency control
<ul>
<li>Must avoid conflicts that occur when
<ul>
<li>someone reads the part of a disk tree that is being merged,</li>
<li>someone searches the memory tree when it is being modified, or</li>
<li>when multiple merges on the same tree are taking place.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Acquire read/write locks on the nodes of the disk trees</li>
<li>Do normal CC on the in-memory tree</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Recovery
<ul>
<li>Rely on normal log</li>
<li>When a checkpoint happens,
<ul>
<li>Finish all pending merges</li>
<li>Write C0 to disk</li>
<li>Flush all dirty disk components</li>
<li>Record the LSN to restart from, the cursors of all components, and some other info.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
