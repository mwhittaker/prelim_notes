<ul>
<li>tl;dr
<ul>
<li>TODO&#8230; new data model, rules, storage system</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Overview
<ul>
<li>object management, knowledge management, and storage system</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The POSTGRES Data Model and Query Language
<ul>
<li>The POSTGRES data model is relational, except that relations are now called classes and tuples are called instances. Also classes can inherit from other classes to inherit all their attributes. All objects are assigned a unique OID, and objects can contain links to one another ( i.e.&#160;navigational).</li>
<li>Attributes can be a simple type, a user-defined abstract base type, an array type, or a compound type (i.e.&#160;a <code>Set&lt;T&gt;</code> or <code>Set&lt;Any&gt;</code>).</li>
<li>POSTGRES users can write their own C functions to operate on their abstract data types. They can also write POSTQUEL functions which are like SQL functions. They can also write their own access methods!</li>
<li>POSTQUEL is like SQL but with support for transitive closure, inheritance queries (i.e.&#160;querying all relations that are a child of some other relation), and time travel.</li>
<li>User code can directly call into POSTGRES internals via a fast path which is like an RPC system.</li>
<li>Classes can be real, derived, or versions. This is described in more detail below.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Rules System
<ul>
<li>POSTGRES supports rules which act like SQL triggers. They are a set of instructions to run whenever a certain event (e.g.&#160;insertion, deletion, update, etc) is made. The rules are meant to be used for a broad class of things including view maintenance, triggers, integrity constraints, referential integrity, and version control.</li>
<li>The rules can use forward chaining (e.g.&#160;whenever I write this, update that) or backwards chaining (e.g.&#160;whenever I query this, query that).</li>
<li>Rules can be implemented at the record level in which each record affected by a rule is tagged with a little token which says which rule to execute. This is good if there are a lot of narrowly scoped rules, since a rule is only fired if an affected row is touched. Alternatively, a query can be rewritten to enforce a set of rules. This is better for a small number of broadly scoped rules.</li>
<li>There are a couple different rule semantics that a user has to choose from. Also, a user has to choose whether to run a rule in the same transaction or a different transaction, and whether the rule should be fired immediately or after it is confirmed that the transaction has committed.</li>
<li>Rules can be used to maintain materialized views. They can also be used to create a version (i.e.&#160;a fork) of a relation by creating an addition and deletion set which are maintained by rules.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Storage System
<ul>
<li>POSTGRES uses a no-overwrite storage system which has two advantages: instantaneous crash recovery and time travel queries.</li>
<li>POSTGRES does not use logging; instead it is forced to write every single modification to disk. This makes it much slower.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The POSTGRES Implementation
<ul>
<li>POSTGRES runs one process per user.</li>
<li>The parser and query optimizer are table driven to allow for maximum extensibility.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Characterization
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Model</strong>: Relational, but with abstract data types and user functions. Also supports inheritance.</li>
<li><strong>Query Language</strong>: POSTQUEL is like SQL with transitive closure, inheritance queries, and time travel queries.</li>
<li><strong>Query Optimization</strong>: N/A</li>
<li><strong>Access Methods and Physical Storage</strong>: No overwrite storage system.</li>
<li><strong>Concurrency Control</strong>: N/A</li>
<li><strong>Recovery</strong>: Instantaneous recovery because of no overwrite storage system.</li>
<li><strong>Misc</strong>: An intricate rule system is used to implement things like views, versions, referential integrity, integrity constraints, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
