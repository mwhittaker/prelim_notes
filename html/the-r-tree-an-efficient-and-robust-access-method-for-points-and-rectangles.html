<ul>
<li>R-tree
<ul>
<li>Like a B+ tree but maps bounding boxes to RIDs</li>
<li>Internal nodes contain bounding boxes of children</li>
<li>Search searches multiple paths, whichever overlaps the query</li>
<li>Insert searches down the path which requires least enlargement (ties broken by area) and potentially splits rearrange to minimize overlap</li>
<li>Delete just deletes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Optimization goals
<ul>
<li>Minimize rectangle area</li>
<li>Minimize rectangle overlap</li>
<li>Minimize rectangle perimeter</li>
<li>Maximize storage utilization</li>
</ul></li>
<li>R-trees vary on find subchild and split
<ul>
<li>Original find subchild: choose one with minimum enlargement (break ties on area)</li>
<li>Original split: minimize overlap</li>
<li>Original split (quadratic approximation): choose two seeds which fill least area of bounding box, then repeatedly pick the other boxes that have the largest difference in area increase when assigned to both groups</li>
<li>Greene's split: choose seeds as above and then divide in half along most distant axis</li>
</ul></li>
<li>R* tree find subchild
<ul>
<li>For internal nodes pointing at internal nodes, use original find</li>
<li>For internal nodes pointing at children, choose child which increases overlap the least, breaking ties by least area increase and then least area. The overlap for a child is the sum of overlaps with all other children.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>R* tree split
<ul>
<li>For each axis, perform all splits where each split has at least m entries</li>
<li>Compute the sum of perimeters for the bounding boxes of all splits</li>
<li>Choose axis which minimizes perimeter</li>
<li>Then choose the partition which minimizes overlap, ties broken by area</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reinsert values (in decreasing order of how far away they are from the bounding box)</li>
</ul>
