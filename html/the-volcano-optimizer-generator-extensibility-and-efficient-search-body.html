<ul>
<li>Overview
<ul>
<li>Volcano is an optimizer generator that takes as input things like logical algebra, physical algebra, and translation rules and outputs a query optimizer that uses a top-down dynamic programming query optimization algorithm.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Design Principles
<ul>
<li>Volcano followed the following design principles:</li>
<li>Lots of domains (e.g.&#160;relational, object relational) are modelled with algebras.</li>
<li>Pattern matching is a good way to describe translations.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t use intermediate representations (don&#8217;t understand this one).</li>
<li>Compile optimizers rather than interpreting them.</li>
<li>Use dynamic programming.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Optimizer Generator Input
<ul>
<li>Volcano takes the following things as input:</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>A set of logical operators (e.g.&#160;join, select, project).</li>
<li>A set of physical algorithms (e.g.&#160;tuple nested loop join, full table scan).</li>
<li>Logical to logical transformation rules (e.g.&#160;join is commutative).</li>
<li>Logical to physical transformation rules (e.g.&#160;join to sort merge join).</li>
<li>Enforcers: algorithms which do not have a corresponding logical algebra operator (e.g.&#160;sort, decompress).</li>
<li>An abstract cost data type and a corresponding cost function for algorithms.</li>
<li>A logical and physical properties data type (e.g.&#160;sorted, compressed) and function for extracting properties of expressions and plans.</li>
<li>Applicability functions saying whether a given algorithm can implement an expression with the given physical properties and the physical requirements on its inputs.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Search Algorithm
<ul>
<li>The Volcano search algorithm has type <code>FindBestPlan(logical plan, physical properties, cost limit) -&gt; physical plan</code>.</li>
<li>Given a logical plan and a desired set of physical properties, it considers the following three kinds of moves:</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>A logical transformation (e.g.&#160;swapping join order).</li>
<li>A logical to physical transformation (e.g.&#160;join to sort merge join).</li>
<li>An enforcer (e.g.&#160;a sort).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The results are memoized in a (logical expression, physical properties) -&gt; best plan hash table.</li>
<li>Volcano uses a couple of tricks to avoid infinite loops and to speed things up. For example, in progress plans are marked in progress to avoid infinite transformation loops.</li>
<li>The cost limit can be used to prune out plans early. For example, if a child of an operator costs more than the limit, we can stop looking at other children. Using a cost limit at all though is not motivated well.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Questions
<ul>
<li>Q: What are the pros and cons of volcano style query optimization vs Selinger style query optimization?</li>
<li>A: This paper says that the Volcano query optimizer is &#8220;driven by needs rather than by possibilities&#8221;. It also says that it&#8217;s useful for when the number of plans exceeds the limits of a bottom-up approach.</li>
</ul></li>
