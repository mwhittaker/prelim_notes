<ul>
<li>What's the point of 2PC
<ul>
<li>Imagine coordinator sends commit to everyone; one node commits, the other crashes and loses all of its data because it didn't force write anything</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Vanilla 2PC
<ul>
<li>coordinator force-write commits and aborts</li>
<li>Subordinate force-writes prepares, commits, and aborts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hierarchical 2PC</li>
<li>2PC with presumed abort
<ul>
<li>The second we know it's an abort, forget about the transaction</li>
<li>Coordinate force-writes commits</li>
<li>Subordinate force-write prepare and commit</li>
<li>Only commits are acked</li>
</ul></li>
<li>2PC with presumed commit
<ul>
<li>Coordinate force-writes collecting and commit</li>
<li>Subordinate force writes prepare and abort</li>
<li>Aborts must be acked</li>
<li>Coordinator crash between collecting and commit, assume abort</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
