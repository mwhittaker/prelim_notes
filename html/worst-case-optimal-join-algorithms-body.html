<ul>
<li>What does it mean to worst case optimal?</li>
<li>What is the AGM bound?</li>
<li>What is the main idea behind the optimal join algorithm? Skew.</li>
<li>Rough structure of join: partition hypergraph and recurse and stuff.</li>
<li>What is leapfrog join?</li>
<li>Two choice algorithm</li>
<li>Why not do optimal join algorithms? Implementation complexity; cache locality; worst case isn't always best.</li>
</ul>
