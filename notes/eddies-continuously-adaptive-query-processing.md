# Eddies: Continuously Adaptive Query Processing
- Adaptability over best case performance
- Synchronization barriers (sort-merge join)
- Moments of symmetry (nested loop join)
- Pre-optimization
- Done and ready bits
- Eddy as a wrapper around data sources and n operators
- Each operator runs in its own thread with a message queue
- Naive eddy: learn delay of operators by filling up message queues
- Fast eddy: learn selectivities of operators using lottery scheduling
- Dynamic performance and windowed lottery scheduling
