# Generalized Isolation Level Definitions
- Degrees of consistency
    - English definitions
    - Degree 1: read uncommitted, long write locks, no read locks
    - Degree 2: read committed, long write locks, short read locks
    - Degree 3: serializable, long write locks, long read (phantom) locks
- ANSI SQL Standard
    - English definitions
    - All wrong
- Critique of ANSI SQL
    - Semi-formal definitions
    - P0: dirty write
    - P1: dirty read
    - P2: non-repeatable read
    - P3: phantom
    - RU: No P0
    - RC: No P0, P1
    - RR: No P0, P1, P2
    - Serializable: No P0, P1, P2, P3
- Adya
    - No multi-versioning
    - Prevents some schedules which are conflict serializable
    - DB model
        - Read and write multiple versions
        - Predicates return version set
    - Dependency graphs
        - Read dependencies (wr) read version of someone else or read a
          predicate which was changed by someone else
        - Write dependencies (ww) wrote next version
        - Anti-dependency (rw) install next version or change predicate of
          something read by previous predicate
    - G0: write cycle
    - G1: read-write cycles, aborted reads, intermediate reads
    - G2: any cycle
    - Pl-1 (RU): no G0
    - Pl-2 (RC): no G0/G1
    - Pl-3 (S): no G0/G1/G2
