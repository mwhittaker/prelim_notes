# Parallel Database Systems: The Future of High Performance Database Processing
- Pipeline vs partition parallelism
- Speedup vs scaleup
- Overheads to perfect scalability
    - Startup
    - Interference
    - Skew
- Shared nothing, shared disk, shared nothing
- Limitations to pipeline parallelism in SQL
    - Query plans not that deep
    - Some operators (e.g. aggregates) cannot be pipelined
    - Some operators take way longer than others
- Round robin, range, and hash partitioning
