- A key-value store that stores (i, wi) pairs for a vector w
- Can use e.g. to run batch gradient descent in parallel
- Cluster of servers and clusters of workers
- Features
    - Range updates
    - User defined functions to run on server
    - Asynchronous task execution
    - Serial, eventual, and bounded delay consistency
- Consistent hashing (with single master) and chain replication
- Compress messages
