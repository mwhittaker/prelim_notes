# The Gamma Database Machine Project
- Software architecture
    - Horizontal parititioning with round robin, hash, or range
    - Catalog manager, query manager, scheduler, operator processes
    - Queries embedded in C or issued ad-hoc
    - Standard relational optimizer with distributed joins
    - Operators act as single node operators with split table attached
- Query processing algorithms
    - Selection trivial
    - Distributed SMJ, Grace hash, simple hash, and hybrid hash equijoins
    - Distributed hybrid hash join implementation (k disks, m procs)
    - Distributed group by (local agg then hash grouping keys)
    - Insert standard w/ movement when partitioning key changed
- Concurrency control
    - S, X, IS, IX, SIX file and page locks
    - Local deadlock detectors plus periodic global detector (time halved
      and doubled)
- Recovery
    - Updates create globally unique LSNs
    - Log entries sent to centralized log managers
    - Log manager sends flushed LSNs back to operators
    - Scheduler sends commit or abort to log managers
    - On abort, operators get aborted entries from log manager
    - Keep extra pages around to avoid waiting on log manager
- Fault tolerance
   - Chained vs interleaved declustering
