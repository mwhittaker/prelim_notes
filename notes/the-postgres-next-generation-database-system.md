# The POSTGRES Next-Generation Database System
- Data management vs object management vs knowledge management
- Query language + multiple programming languages + few concepts
- Data models
    - Classes (with inheritance), instances, attributes, OIDs
    - Base classes, derived classes, versions
    - Base types, array types, compond types
    - C functions, operators, POSTQUEL functions
- POSTQUEL
    - Subqueries, transitive closures, inheritance, time travel
- Fast path
    - Sometimes easier than constructing SQL + allows for optimization
      tricks
- Rules
    - Rules for view maintenance, triggers, constraints, etc.
    - Forward chaining and backward chaining
    - Record-level and query rewrite implementations
    - Deferred vs immediate and same txn vs different txn
    - Using rules for views and versions
- Storage system
    - No-overwrite storage system
    - Fast recovery (no need to undo) and historical queries
- Implementation
    - Process per query
    - Table driven parser and optimizer
    - Dynamically loaded types, operators, and functions
