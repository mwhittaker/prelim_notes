# Worst-Case Optimal Join Algorithms
- What does it mean to worst case optimal?
- What is the AGM bound?
- What is the main idea behind the optimal join algorithm? Skew.
- Rough structure of join: partition hypergraph and recurse and stuff.
- What is leapfrog join?
- Two choice algorithm
- Why not do optimal join algorithms? Implementation complexity; cache
  locality; worst case isn't always best.
